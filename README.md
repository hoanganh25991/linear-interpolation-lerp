# Linear Interpolation (Lerp)

This repository is a comprehensive follow-through of the linear interpolation (Lerp) concepts and JavaScript applications as taught in the [Linear Interpolation (Lerp) - Math and JavaScript Applications YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_puRs40GhM).

## Introduction

Linear interpolation is a method of curve fitting using linear polynomials to construct new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points. It's a crucial technique in computer graphics, animations, and in solving engineering problems where a simple, yet effective approximation between two points is needed.

In this repository, you'll find the detailed implementation of the Lerp function in JavaScript, which can be utilized for various applications including animations, game development, data visualization, and more.

## What's Inside

- **Lerp Function Implementation**: The heart of this repository, where we translate the mathematical concept of linear interpolation into JavaScript code.

- **Examples**: Several practical examples showing how to use the Lerp function in different scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and explore the different JavaScript files that contain the Lerp function and its applications. The comments in the code will guide you through the process, and you can refer to the YouTube tutorial for an in-depth explanation of the concepts.
